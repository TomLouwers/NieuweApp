What Would Actually Help Me (As a Burned-Out Dutch Teacher)
Let me be completely honest with you.
What I DON'T Need
Another tool to learn. I'm drowning. The last thing I want is to spend an hour figuring out how your AI works.
More features. You keep talking about Werkmap, Teams integration, SLO tracking. I don't care. I just want my weekends back.
Promises about saving time. Every tool promises this. ParnasSys promised it. Our new methode promised it. None delivered.
What Would Actually Make Me Try Your Product
1. Solve ONE thing I'm doing THIS week
Don't tell me about all your features. Tell me:
"You have to write a groepsplan by Friday. Give me 10 minutes right now, and you'll never have to write one from scratch again."
That's it. That's the pitch.
If it works, I'll come back. If it doesn't, I won't - no matter how many other features you have.
2. Make it work with my chaos
My reality:

I have a half-finished groepsplan from last year somewhere in my email
My school uses a specific format that my IB'er is very particular about
I don't have time to "set up" anything
I need this done by Friday and it's already Wednesday

Your tool needs to handle this mess, not require me to be organized first.
3. Don't make me fear the inspectie
If I use your AI-generated groepsplan and the inspectie rejects it, I'm in trouble. Not you - me.
So either:

Guarantee it's inspectie-proof (with actual evidence, not marketing speak)
Or let me see what other teachers in my position have successfully used
Or have someone with credibility (IB'er, PO-raad) vouch for it

Without this, I'm not risking it for official documents.
4. Show me it works in 30 seconds
Not a demo video. Not a sales pitch. Not a tour of features.
Let me upload my old groepsplan right now, no account needed, and show me an improved version in 30 seconds.
If it's good, I'll sign up.
If it's mediocre, I'll use ChatGPT.
If I have to watch a video first, I'll close the tab.
5. Price it so I don't have to ask permission
If it's more than €10/month, I have to ask my school. That means:

Asking my directeur
Waiting for the next budget meeting
Justifying why I need it
Probably getting rejected because "we already have ParnasSys"

At €10/month, I'll just pay it myself if it saves me 2 hours.
At €20/month, I have to think about it.
At €30+/month, I need school approval, which means months of waiting.
6. Make it work on my phone
I'm not at my laptop at 22:00 on Sunday when I remember I need to finish that groepsplan.
I'm on my couch with my phone.
If I can't use your tool on my phone, I'll use something else.
What Would Make Me Actually PAY (Not Just Try)
After 2 weeks of free trial, I'll only pay if:

I actually used it 3+ times (not just tried it once)
It saved me at least 2 hours (measurable, not theoretical)
The output was good enough to actually submit (not just "interesting" or "helpful")
Nobody complained about it (no IB'er comments, no colleague questions)
I feel anxious about losing access ("Oh no, I need this for next groepsplan")

If all five are true, I'll pay €10/month without hesitation.
If only 3 are true, I'll probably cancel.
If less than 3, I'll definitely cancel.
The Real Question You Should Ask Me
Not "what features do you want?"
But: "What are you doing this week that you absolutely hate?"
My answer today: Writing an OPP for a student with dyslexie. I have to:

Describe current situation (I've already written this 3x this year)
Set goals (same goals as last OPP, just different wording)
Describe approach (copy from previous OPP with minor tweaks)
Plan evaluation moments (same schedule as always)
Format it in our school's template (fiddly Word formatting)
Get it done by Thursday for gesprek with ouders

Total time: 2.5 hours
Time that's actually thinking: 20 minutes
Time that's repetitive copying/formatting: 2 hours 10 minutes
If your tool could do that 2 hours 10 minutes for me, I'd pay €20/month happily.
If it can't, I don't care about any other features.
Bottom Line
You asked: "How can I help you?"
Help me by making Friday less awful.
Not by building a comprehensive platform.
Not by offering 8 different features.
Not by having the best AI or the most integrations.
Just: Make the thing I'm dreading this week take 10 minutes instead of 2 hours.
Do that, and I'm yours.
Fail at that, and I don't care how amazing your roadmap is.
That's the truth from a burned-out leerkracht who's heard too many promises from too many tools.
