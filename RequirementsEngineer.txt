Document ID: REQ-PEBBLE-2025-001
Version: 1.0
Date: October 2025
Author: Senior Requirements Engineer
Stakeholder: Primary School Teachers (Netherlands)

1. Executive Summary
1.1 Problem Statement
Dutch primary school teachers spend 8+ hours weekly on repetitive administrative tasks (groepsplannen, OPP's, gespreksverslagen), causing burnout and reducing time for actual teaching. Existing tools add complexity rather than reducing burden.
1.2 Core User Need
"Make Friday less awful by reducing this week's most dreaded task from 2 hours to 10 minutes."
1.3 Success Criteria

User completes onboarding in <60 seconds
First document generated in <30 seconds
Output quality sufficient for direct submission (no major rewrites)
User returns within 7 days to generate second document
User willing to pay after demonstrating value


2. User Persona & Context
2.1 Primary User Profile
Name: Representative Dutch Primary Teacher
Age: 35-55
Experience: 10-25 years teaching
Technical proficiency: Low to medium (uses email, WhatsApp, basic Word)
Work context:

Teaches 25-30 students
Works 50+ hours/week (40 contracted)
Has 2-4 hours weekly for admin (insufficient)
Under constant time pressure
Risk-averse regarding inspectie compliance

2.2 User's Current Workflow (OPP Example)
Total time: 2.5 hours
Breakdown:

Retrieve previous OPP: 10 min (searching email/drive)
Copy relevant sections: 15 min
Rewrite for current period: 45 min
Format in school template: 30 min
Proofread and adjust: 20 min
Save and file: 5 min

Pain points:

85% of time is repetitive copying/formatting
15% is actual new thinking
High anxiety about getting format/structure wrong
Multiple interruptions extend task across days

2.3 Environmental Constraints

Works on personal laptop (school desktop is slow)
Unreliable school WiFi
Limited uninterrupted time (home after 22:00)
Must work on mobile device when away from desk
Cannot install software requiring admin rights

8. Risk Assessment
8.1 High-Risk Items
Risk: AI output quality insufficient

Impact: Users don't trust output, won't pay
Likelihood: Medium
Mitigation:

Test with 20 teachers before launch
Human review option (premium tier)
Continuous prompt optimization based on feedback


Contingency: Pivot to AI-assisted (human edits AI draft) vs. fully automated

Risk: Inspectie compliance concerns prevent adoption

Impact: Teachers avoid for official documents
Likelihood: High
Mitigation:

Get IB'er validation
Compliance checklist built-in
Conservative default templates
Insurance: "If inspectie rejects structure, we fix free"


Contingency: Partner with onderwijsadviseur for review service

Risk: Pricing too high for individual adoption

Impact: Low conversion from trial to paid
Likelihood: Medium
Mitigation:

Test pricing during pre-launch email capture
Offer annual discount
Provide ROI calculator ("€10/month = €0.16 per hour saved")


Contingency: Lower to €7.99/month if conversion <15%

8.2 Medium-Risk Items
Risk: Solo founder burnout

Impact: Development stalls, support suffers
Mitigation: Define scope strictly, use no-code where possible, automate support
Contingency: Seek co-founder or freelance support help

Risk: Competition from free alternatives (ChatGPT)

Impact: "Why pay when ChatGPT is free?"
Mitigation: Emphasize integrations, compliance, ease-of-use
Contingency: Add unique features ChatGPT can't replicate (school templates, compliance)
